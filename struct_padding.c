/*
Header Inclusion: #include<stdio.h> includes the Standard Input Output Library which is necessary for input/output operations (e.g., using printf).

Structure Definition and Declaration: The struct demo is defined with three members, two chars and one int. A variable dem of this structure type is also declared globally.

The main Function: Execution starts from here. A common entry point for C programs.

Variable Declarations: Variables i (though it remains unused) and d are declared as integers within main.

Size Calculation: d = sizeof(dem); calculates the size of the structure instance dem in bytes and stores this in the integer d.

Output Statements: The code incorrectly states "The size of the structure expected is : 6 bytes" but then correctly prints the actual size calculated by sizeof(dem).

Important Note on Structure Size:
The actual size might not be simply the sum of its members' sizes (int is commonly 4 bytes, and char is 1 byte) because of padding added by the compiler for alignment purposes. This means the size of struct demo could potentially be more than 6 bytes, depending on the system and compiler. Alignment increases the performance of memory accesses, so compilers automatically insert these padding bytes.

For example, depending on the system/compiler, the actual size might be 8 bytes due to padding added after the char members to align the int on a 4-byte boundary in memory for efficient access.
