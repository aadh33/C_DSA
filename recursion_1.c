/*
Incorrect Recursive Call:
In original code:
int sum(int x) {
    int s = 0;
    if (x == 1) {
        return x;
    } else {
        s = s + sum(x);  // Problematic line
        return s;
    }
}
The line s = s + sum(x); inside the sum function attempts to call sum(x) recursively with the same value of x without changing it (sum(x) leads to infinite recursion). This causes the function to repeatedly call itself with no base case to stop the recursion, leading to a stack overflow.

Resetting s in Each Call:
Even if the recursive call was correct, resetting s = 0; at the beginning of each sum function call prevents s from accumulating the correct sum.

Incorrect main Function:
The main function in C should return an integer (int) type, not void. This is a syntax error.
Recursive Sum Function (sum):
Base Case:
The base case in recursion is crucial to prevent infinite recursion. In the corrected sum function:

int sum(int x) {
    if (x == 1) {
        return 1;  // Base case: sum of 1 is 1
    } else {
        return x + sum(x - 1);  // Recursive call to sum numbers from 1 to x-1
    }
}
When sum(1) is called, it returns 1 directly (base case).

Recursive Case:
For x greater than 1, sum(x) recursively calls sum(x - 1) and adds x to the result. This effectively computes the sum of numbers from 1 to x.

main Function:
Return Type of main:
In C, the main function must have a return type of int.

Function Execution:
The main function:
int main() {
    int b;
    b = sum(5);  // Call the sum function to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to 5
    printf("The value after the calculation is %d\n", b);  // Print the result
    return 0;  // Indicates successful program termination
}
Calls the sum function with 5 to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.
Stores the result in variable b.
Prints the calculated sum using printf.
Returns 0 to indicate successful termination of the program (0 conventionally represents successful execution).
Main Concepts:
Recursion:
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller instances of the same problem (subproblems), usually with a base case that stops the recursion.

Base Case:
The base case is the condition in a recursive function that stops the recursion. It defines the simplest case where the function returns a known value without making further recursive calls.

Recursive Case:
The recursive case is the part of a recursive function where the function calls itself with modified arguments to solve a smaller instance of the problem.

Function Execution in C:

Functions in C have a return type (int in this case).
Recursive functions in C must have proper base cases to avoid infinite recursion.
Global and local variables have distinct scopes and lifetimes.
The main function is the entry point of a C program and must return an integer value to the operating system (0 indicates successful execution).
