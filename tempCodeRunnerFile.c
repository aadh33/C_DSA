In summary, this program demonstrates the usage of a simple function (sum) 
to calculate the sum of two integers (x and y) entered by the user. 
The main function calls the sum function to perform this calculation,
 and then prints the result using printf.
 This example highlights the concepts of function declaration,
  definition, return type, and function invocation with user input,
   working of function without argument and with returntype  
  and output in C programming.
