/*
Pointer Casting:
(void *) p is an example of pointer casting. It converts the pointer p (which originally points to an int) into a generic pointer of type void *.
The (void *) cast allows us to treat the pointer p as a generic pointer without specifying its original data type.
The void * type is a special pointer type that can hold any data type. Itâ€™s often used when we want to work with pointers in a more generic way.
Why Use (void *)?
In this specific case, the program is printing the memory addresses of the elements in the array.
By using (void *), the program avoids specifying the exact data type of the pointer. This is useful because the array a contains integers (int), but we want to print their memory addresses without any type-specific formatting.
When we use %p in the printf format string, it expects a void * argument. By casting p to (void *), we satisfy this requirement.
Benefits of Using (void *):
Flexibility: By using (void *), we can print the memory addresses of any data type (not just int). For example, if we had an array of double or a custom struct, we could still use the same code to print their addresses.
Avoiding Warnings: Without the cast, some compilers might issue warnings about incompatible pointer types. Casting to (void *) suppresses these warnings.
Remember that (void *) is a powerful tool for working with pointers in a more generic manner. It allows us to handle different data types uniformly when dealing with memory addresses
